<p>Everyone is used to the fact that Apple accessories are more than just an addition. These things are self-sufficient and often unique. This is how Apple AirPods can be described. The new wireless headset will change your perception of simple and familiar things. No wires, decent sound quality, incredible and stylish corporate design - these headphones undoubtedly deserve attention.</p>
<h2>Why a headphone processor?</h2>
<p>In the list of technical characteristics of Apple AirPods, we can see the W1 processor. Moreover, he answers in this model not only for the formation of a sound signal. Headphones know what you are doing at the moment: Whether you are using 1 or 2 headphones, talking or listening to music - the system will automatically adjust to the required mode, create sound isolation, pause the music and turn it on again.</p>
<h2>Decent autonomy</h2>
<p>But from a mobile gadget, you need not only a range of capabilities, but also the possibility of long-term work. Apple AirPods will be able to play music continuously for 5:00. Using the charging case will make you autonomous for a day. At the same time, 15 minutes of recharging will give you another 3:00 of music and communication!</p>";"navushniki-apple-air-pods-white-23036509454069.jpg, navushniki-apple-air-pods-white-73708186741804.jpg";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

<li><strong>Improved dynamic capabilities</strong>. Despite the upgrade of the technical part, the mass of the quadrocopter has not increased &ndash; this was facilitated by the use of a frame made of magnesium, aluminum and titanium. The device can spend up to 30 minutes in the air, rising to a height of up to 6 kilometers above sea level. The maximum horizontal flight speed is 20 m / s (72 km / h), and the rise &ndash; 6 m/s (21.6 km/h). An advanced dual-band radio control system allows the aircraft to exchange signals with the remote control at a distance of up to 7 km in the absence of obstacles.</li>
<li><strong>Total security</strong>. The FlightAutonomy system received two new micro-cameras and two infrared sensors located on the sides. Thanks to this, the quadcopter can recognize obstacles even in low light and automatically correct the course to avoid a collision. This feature is useful for both beginners and professional videographers, who get the opportunity to focus on the shooting process.</li>
<li><strong>Easy management</strong>. There is nothing superfluous on the standard remote &ndash; the aircraft can be controlled using two mini-joysticks and two buttons. All additional functions are activated using a proprietary mobile application. In the standard version, the remote control is equipped with a holder for a smartphone, and in the PLUS version &ndash; retractable screen with a very bright backlight (1000 cd/m2), allowing you to see all the details of the image even when exposed to direct sunlight.</li>
<li><strong>Automatic Flight Programs</strong>. DRAW technology allows you to draw the course of a quadrocopter on the touch screen &ndash; the device will follow it at a constant altitude, allowing you to pay maximum attention to the precise aiming of the camera. In addition, the aircraft can simply be shown the end point to which it will reach, bypassing all obstacles. Videographers will especially benefit from the automatic tracking of a moving object and the release of the shutter when gestures are recognized.</li>
