<h3>Incredibly durable</h3>
<p>Apple iPhone 12 is housed in an aluminum case with flat side edges. The entire front panel is occupied by a beautiful 6.1-inch OLED display with Super Retina XDR technology. This smartphone introduces for the first time a completely new coating technology - Ceramic Shield. It is glass with nano-inclusions of transparent ceramics, which make it incredibly durable. Now you can not be afraid to drop your smartphone - the probability of breaking the screen when falling is now less than 4 times.</p>

<h3>Amazingly fast</h3>
<p>Apple iPhone 12 is powered by the most powerful new generation A14 Bionic chip. The overall performance of the smartphone has increased by 40% compared to the previous model. The 4-core graphics accelerator is 30% more powerful, and the improved 16-core Neural Engine is 10 times faster than its predecessor. At the same time, the power consumption of the new processor has decreased. This smartphone will perform any applications, any operations without the slightest delay. The iPhone 12 now makes it possible to execute the most complex algorithms of processing and machine learning, best seen in the incredible capabilities of its cameras.</p>

<h3>Replaces film studio</h3>
<p>iPhone 12 received two cameras: wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle. Apple's excellent cameras have received an upgrade this year with improved imaging technology. Night mode is now supported for both modules. This means shots taken in low light will be more detailed and sharper. In addition, you can now shoot a time-lapse in night mode. The new smartphone can shoot video in HDR 4K mode in the Dolby Vision standard, which is an absolute record not only among smartphone cameras, but also among many professional camcorders.</p>

<h3>Incredibly durable</h3>
<p>Apple iPhone 12 is housed in an aluminum case with flat side edges. The entire front panel is occupied by a beautiful 6.1-inch OLED display with Super Retina XDR technology. This smartphone introduces for the first time a completely new coating technology - Ceramic Shield. It is glass with nano-inclusions of transparent ceramics, which make it incredibly durable.

<h3>Replaces film studio</h3>
<p>iPhone 12 received two cameras: wide-angle and ultra-wide-angle. Apple's excellent cameras have received an upgrade this year with improved imaging technology.

The new smartphone can shoot video in HDR 4K mode in the Dolby Vision standard, which is an absolute record not only among smartphone cameras, but also among many professional camcorders.</p>
