<p>Everyone is used to the fact that Apple accessories are more than just an addition. These things are self-sufficient and often unique. This is how Apple AirPods can be described. The new wireless headset will change your perception of simple and familiar things. No wires, decent sound quality, incredible and stylish corporate design - these headphones undoubtedly deserve attention.</p>
<h2>Why a headphone processor?</h2>
<p>In the list of technical characteristics of Apple AirPods, we can see the W1 processor. Moreover, he answers in this model not only for the formation of a sound signal. Headphones know what you are doing at the moment: Whether you are using 1 or 2 headphones, talking or listening to music - the system will automatically adjust to the required mode, create sound isolation, pause the music and turn it on again.</p>
<h2>Decent autonomy</h2>
<p>But from a mobile gadget, you need not only a range of capabilities, but also the possibility of long-term work. Apple AirPods will be able to play music continuously for 5:00. Using the charging case will make you autonomous for a day. At the same time, 15 minutes of recharging will give you another 3:00 of music and communication!</p>";"apple-airpods-1.png, apple-airpods-2.png, apple-airpods-3.png, apple-airpods-4.png";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
