# Change log

# 4.8.03
- [x] added optional `$config` to MobileDetect constructor.
- [x] added `autoInitOfHttpHeaders` configuration which is by default `true`. This enabled the old behavior from `3.x` and `2.x` that allows automatic detection of HTTP headers and User Agent from $_SERVER.
- [x] refactored internal CloudFront related methods and the way `setHttpHeaders` work. It no longer falls back on `$_SERVER`. The method still calls `setUserAgent` in case `HTTP_USER_AGENT` and friends are present.
- [x] added `maximumUserAgentLength` to the `$config`, by default the limit is `500`.
